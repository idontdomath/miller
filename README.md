Miller
======

A black mirror, squezzing bits at each movement of your body.
An existance that dissapears without motion.

I wanted to explore real-time video processing linking it with music generation (and noise). 
Based on change calculations on eachï»¿ frame as a way of detecting movement, I've extracted ratios of variations between each of them and use them to generate sound, resulting in an eerie experience.

A sort of movement sequencing: high pitch on movement with a clear personal representation on the screen and deep sounds triggered by screen dissaperance when remaining motionless.

Keep the volume down if you are going to try it with headphones.
